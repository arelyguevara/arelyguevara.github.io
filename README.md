# Landing Page
Experimenting with THREE animations I decided to build something with the [threex.terrain extension](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.terrain)

## Usage
This is a static site using HTML, CSS and the THREE.js WEBGL library without any npm scripts (at this moment).

You will have to clone or download this repo and find the path to the index.html file and paste it in your browser.

Alternately, you can use this command within your terminal to open the site:

```
cd arelyguevara.github.io
open ./index.html
```
